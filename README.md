# Regression Based Recipe Analysis and Prediction
# Introduction
Hello! The purpose of this project is to do some analysis on recipes, as well as do a little bit of machine learning. This project is primarily split into two parts: the first part is conducting a simple permutation test, and the second part is incorporating machine learning to predict how long a recipe will take.
